This repo is was started with the code from the Realtek USB driver
RTL8852AU_WiFi_linux_v1.15.0.1-0-g487ee886.20210714. The current code improves
on the Realtek code by reworking the debug output to avoid spamming the logs.
In the current settings, messages from RTW_ERR(), RTW_WARNING(), and
RTW_WARNING() will be output.

If you want more output, increase the value of CONFIG_RTW_LOG_LEVEL in Makefile.
This parameter should probably be one that can be set at module load time,
but that is a matter for another time.

The driver supports rtl8832au/rtl8852au chipsets. 

This driver currently handles the following devices:

ASUS USB-AX56 with USB ID 0b05:1997  
BUFFALO WI-U3-1200AX2(/N) with USB ID 0411:0312  
D-Link DWA-X1850 with USB IF 2001:3321  
Fenvi FU-AX1800P with USB ID 0bda:885c  
Realtek Demo Board with USB ID 0bda:8832   
Realtek Demo Board with USB ID 0bda:885a  
Realtek Demo Board with USB ID 0bda:885c  

The D-Link DWA-X1850 comes with a configuration that appears to be a USB disk,
which contains a Windows driver. If a 'lsusb' command shows the ID 0bda:1a2b,
then this disk is mounted. The way to avoid this is to edit either file
/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules, or
/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules, whichever is on your system, and add
the following lines:

\# D-Link DWA-X1850 Wifi Dongle  
ATTR{idVendor}=="0bda", ATTR{idProduct}=="1a2b", RUN+="usb_modeswitch '/%k'"

When a USB device is plugged in, or detected at boot, this rule causes the utulity
usb_modeswitch to unload any 0bda:1a2b devices that it finds. If you have a
device with different ID, change the rule accordingly.

The build this driver, do the following:

git clone http://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8852au.git  
cd rtw8852au  
make  
sudo make install

When your kernel is updated, then do a 'git pull' and redo the make commands.

##### Installation with module signing for SecureBoot
For all distros:
```bash
git clone git://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8814au.git
cd rtl8814au
make
sudo make sign-install
```
You will be promted for a password, please keep it in mind and use it in next steps.

Reboot to activate the new installed module.
In the MOK managerment screen:
1. Select "Enroll key" and enroll the key created by above sign-install step
2. When promted, enter the password you entered when create sign key. 

If you enter wrong password, your computer won't not rebootable. In this case,
   use the BOOT menu from your BIOS, to boot into your OS then do below steps:

```bash
sudo mokutil --reset
```
Restart your computer
Use BOOT menu from BIOS to boot into your OS
In the MOK managerment screen, select reset MOK list
Reboot then retry from the step make sign-install
