This repo is was started with the code from the Realtek USB driver
RTL8852AU_WiFi_linux_v1.15.0.1-0-g487ee886.20210714. The current code improves
on the Realtek code by reworking the debug output to avoid spamming the logs.
In the current settings, messages from RTW_ERR(), RTW_WARNING(), and
RTW_WARNING() will be output.

If you want more output, increase the value of CONFIG_RTW_LOG_LEVEL in Makefile.
This parameter should probably be one that can be set at module load time,
but that is a matter for another time.

The driver supports rtl8832au/rtl8852au chipsets. 

This driver currently handles the following devices:

ASUS USB-AX56 with USB ID 0b05:1997  
BUFFALO WI-U3-1200AX2(/N) with USB ID 0411:0312  
D-Link DWA-X1850 with USB IF 2001:3321  
Fenvi FU-AX1800P with USB ID 0bda:885c  
Realtek Demo Board with USB ID 0bda:8832   
Realtek Demo Board with USB ID 0bda:885a  
Realtek Demo Board with USB ID 0bda:885c  

The D-Link DWA-X1850 comes with a configuration that appears to be a USB disk,
which contains a Windows driver. If a 'lsusb' command shows the ID 0bda:1a2b,
then this disk is mounted. The way to avoid this is to edit either file
/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules, or
/lib/udev/rules.d/40-usb_modeswitch.rules, whichever is on your system, and add
the following lines:

\# D-Link DWA-X1850 Wifi Dongle  
ATTR{idVendor}=="0bda", ATTR{idProduct}=="1a2b", RUN+="usb_modeswitch '/%k'"

When a USB device is plugged in, or detected at boot, this rule causes the utulity
usb_modeswitch to unload any 0bda:1a2b devices that it finds. If you have a
device with different ID, change the rule accordingly.

The build this driver, do the following:

git clone http://github.com/lwfinger/rtl8852au.git  
cd rtw8852au  
make  
sudo make install

When your kernel is updated, then do a 'git pull' and redo the make commands.

If you are running a system with secure boot, the driver will not load.
Fixing that problem is beyond the scope of the README.
